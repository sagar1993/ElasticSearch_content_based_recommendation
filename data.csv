1,"Programming is essentially thinking of solutions to problems in real life as a system. With any programming language, you need to know how to address real-life problems into something that could be accurately represented within a computer system. In order to begin programming with the Java programming language (or in fact, with any programming language), a programmer must first understand the basics of abstraction.Abstraction is the process of representing real-life problems and objects into your programs.Suppose a novelist, a painter and a programmer were asked to abstract (i.e., represent ) a real-life object in their work. Suppose, the real-life object that needs to be abstracted is an animal . Abstraction for a novelist would include writing the description of the animal whilst the painter would draw a picture of the animal – but what about a computer programmer?The Java programming language uses a programming paradigm called object-oriented programming (OOP) , which shows you exactly what a programmer needs to be doing. According to OOP, every object or problem in real-life can be translated into a virtual object within your computer system.",Recent changes The process of abstraction,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Category:Book:Java_Programming
2,"In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an object within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition . All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets – anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., class ).

In order to do so however, you need to write a special syntax that goes like this:The code above effectively creates an object called dog based on the class definition for Animal .

A single class definition enables you to create multiple objects as the code below indicates:Basically, you just have to write the code for your class or type definition once, and then use it to create countless numbers of objects based on that specification.

4,"Although each object you create from a class definition is essentially the same, there has to be a way of differentiating those objects in your code. Object fields (or simply fields ) are what makes your objects unique from other objects. Let's take our present abstraction for instance. An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types .

The String data type is used for fields that can hold textual values like names, while the int (integer) data type is used for fields that can hold numeric valuesIn order to demonstrate how fields work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:You can access the fields of your created objects by using the . (dot) or membership operator . In the example above, we created two objects: animal1 and animal2 of type Animal . And since, we had established that each Animal has two fields namely name and legs , we accessed and modified these fields for each of our objects using the membership operator to set the two apart. By declaring different values for different objects, we can manipulate their current state . So, for instance:the animal1 object is a ""dog"" with 4 legs to walk with; while,  the animal2 object is a ""duck"" with 2 legs to walk with.What sets the two objects apart is their current state.

Let's say, as an analogy, you want your Animal object to be able to walk in its environment. Thus, you need to add a method named walk to our object. To do so, we need to write the following code:As you write this code, one thing becomes immediately apparent. Just like the class description, a method has curly brackets as well.

With any programming language, you need to know how to address real-life problems into something that could be accurately represented within a computer system. In order to begin programming with the Java programming language (or in fact, with any programming language), a programmer must first understand the basics of abstraction.Abstraction is the process of representing real-life problems and objects into your programs.Suppose a novelist, a painter and a programmer were asked to abstract (i.e., represent ) a real-life object in their work. Suppose, the real-life object that needs to be abstracted is an animal . Abstraction for a novelist would include writing the description of the animal whilst the painter would draw a picture of the animal – but what about a computer programmer?The Java programming language uses a programming paradigm called object-oriented programming (OOP) , which shows you exactly what a programmer needs to be doing.

58,"In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an object within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition . All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets – anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., class ).

In order to do so however, you need to write a special syntax that goes like this:The code above effectively creates an object called dog based on the class definition for Animal . In non-programmer parlance, the code above would translate into something akin to saying, ""Create a new object dog of type Animal ."" A single class definition enables you to create multiple objects as the code below indicates:Basically, you just have to write the code for your class or type definition once, and then use it to create countless numbers of objects based on that specification.

81,"Although each object you create from a class definition is essentially the same, there has to be a way of differentiating those objects in your code. Object fields (or simply fields ) are what makes your objects unique from other objects. Let's take our present abstraction for instance. An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types . The String data type is used for fields that can hold textual values like names, while the int (integer) data type is used for fields that can hold numeric valuesIn order to demonstrate how fields work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:You can access the fields of your created objects by using the .

So, for instance:the animal1 object is a ""dog"" with 4 legs to walk with; while,  the animal2 object is a ""duck"" with 2 legs to walk with.What sets the two objects apart is their current state.

Abstraction for a novelist would include writing the description of the animal whilst the painter would draw a picture of the animal – but what about a computer programmer?The Java programming language uses a programming paradigm called object-oriented programming (OOP) , which shows you exactly what a programmer needs to be doing. According to OOP, every object or problem in real-life can be translated into a virtual object within your computer system.",Conditional blocks The process of abstraction,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Conditional_blocks
107,"In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an object within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition . All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets – anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., class ). Such predefined words in the Java language are known as keywords and make up the grammar for the language (known as programming syntax ).",Conditional blocks Thinking in objects,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Conditional_blocks
108,"Aristotle was perhaps the first person to think of abstract types or typologies of objects. He started calling them classes – e.g., classes of birds, classes of mammals. Class definitions therefore serve the purpose well in defining the common characteristics or types of objects you would be creating. Upon declaring a class definition, you can create objects based on that definition. In order to do so however, you need to write a special syntax that goes like this:The code above effectively creates an object called dog based on the class definition for Animal . In non-programmer parlance, the code above would translate into something akin to saying, ""Create a new object dog of type Animal ."" A single class definition enables you to create multiple objects as the code below indicates:Basically, you just have to write the code for your class or type definition once, and then use it to create countless numbers of objects based on that specification. Although you might not grasp the importance of doing so, this little exercise saves you a lot of time (a luxury that was not readily available to programmers in the pre-Java days).",Conditional blocks Understanding class definitions and types,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Conditional_blocks
109,"Although each object you create from a class definition is essentially the same, there has to be a way of differentiating those objects in your code. Object fields (or simply fields ) are what makes your objects unique from other objects. Let's take our present abstraction for instance. An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types . The String data type is used for fields that can hold textual values like names, while the int (integer) data type is used for fields that can hold numeric valuesIn order to demonstrate how fields work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:You can access the fields of your created objects by using the . (dot) or membership operator . In the example above, we created two objects: animal1 and animal2 of type Animal . And since, we had established that each Animal has two fields namely name and legs , we accessed and modified these fields for each of our objects using the membership operator to set the two apart. By declaring different values for different objects, we can manipulate their current state . So, for instance:the animal1 object is a ""dog"" with 4 legs to walk with; while,  the animal2 object is a ""duck"" with 2 legs to walk with.What sets the two objects apart is their current state. Both the objects have different states and thus stand out as two different objects even though they were created from the same template or class definition.",Conditional blocks Expanding your class definitions,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Conditional_blocks

To add this capability for interaction, you need to add interactive behavior to your object class definitions as well. Such behavior is added to class definitions using a programming construct called method .In the case of the Animal , you require your virtual representation of an animal to be able to move through its environment. Let's say, as an analogy, you want your Animal object to be able to walk in its environment. Thus, you need to add a method named walk to our object. To do so, we need to write the following code:As you write this code, one thing becomes immediately apparent. Just like the class description, a method has curly brackets as well. Generally, curly brackets are used to define an area (or scope ) within your object. So the first set of curly brackets defined a scope for your class definition called the class-level scope .

135,"In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an object within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system.

To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition .

In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life.

As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types .

To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition . All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets – anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., class ). Such predefined words in the Java language are known as keywords and make up the grammar for the language (known as programming syntax ).",Defining classes Thinking in objects,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Defining_Classes

As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types .

Object fields (or simply fields ) are what makes your objects unique from other objects. Let's take our present abstraction for instance. An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types . The String data type is used for fields that can hold textual values like names, while the int (integer) data type is used for fields that can hold numeric valuesIn order to demonstrate how fields work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:You can access the fields of your created objects by using the .

With any programming language, you need to know how to address real-life problems into something that could be accurately represented within a computer system. In order to begin programming with the Java programming language (or in fact, with any programming language), a programmer must first understand the basics of abstraction.Abstraction is the process of representing real-life problems and objects into your programs.Suppose a novelist, a painter and a programmer were asked to abstract (i.e., represent ) a real-life object in their work. Suppose, the real-life object that needs to be abstracted is an animal . Abstraction for a novelist would include writing the description of the animal whilst the painter would draw a picture of the animal – but what about a computer programmer?The Java programming language uses a programming paradigm called object-oriented programming (OOP) , which shows you exactly what a programmer needs to be doing.

401,"In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an object within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition . All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets – anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., class ).

In non-programmer parlance, the code above would translate into something akin to saying, ""Create a new object dog of type Animal ."" A single class definition enables you to create multiple objects as the code below indicates:Basically, you just have to write the code for your class or type definition once, and then use it to create countless numbers of objects based on that specification.

An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types .

An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition . All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets – anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., class ).

Suppose, the real-life object that needs to be abstracted is an animal .

An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system.

To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition .

In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life.

An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types .

For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types . The String data type is used for fields that can hold textual values like names, while the int (integer) data type is used for fields that can hold numeric valuesIn order to demonstrate how fields work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:You can access the fields of your created objects by using the . (dot) or membership operator . In the example above, we created two objects: animal1 and animal2 of type Animal . And since, we had established that each Animal has two fields namely name and legs , we accessed and modified these fields for each of our objects using the membership operator to set the two apart. By declaring different values for different objects, we can manipulate their current state . So, for instance:the animal1 object is a ""dog"" with 4 legs to walk with; while,  the animal2 object is a ""duck"" with 2 legs to walk with.What sets the two objects apart is their current state. Both the objects have different states and thus stand out as two different objects even though they were created from the same template or class definition.",Dynamic Class Loading Expanding your class definitions,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Reflection/Dynamic_Class_Loading

To add this capability for interaction, you need to add interactive behavior to your object class definitions as well.

Let's say, as an analogy, you want your Animal object to be able to walk in its environment. Thus, you need to add a method named walk to our object. To do so, we need to write the following code:As you write this code, one thing becomes immediately apparent. Just like the class description, a method has curly brackets as well. Generally, curly brackets are used to define an area (or scope ) within your object. So the first set of curly brackets defined a scope for your class definition called the class-level scope .

With any programming language, you need to know how to address real-life problems into something that could be accurately represented within a computer system. In order to begin programming with the Java programming language (or in fact, with any programming language), a programmer must first understand the basics of abstraction.Abstraction is the process of representing real-life problems and objects into your programs.Suppose a novelist, a painter and a programmer were asked to abstract (i.e., represent ) a real-life object in their work. Suppose, the real-life object that needs to be abstracted is an animal .

639,"In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an object within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition . All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets – anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., class ).

641,"Although each object you create from a class definition is essentially the same, there has to be a way of differentiating those objects in your code. Object fields (or simply fields ) are what makes your objects unique from other objects. Let's take our present abstraction for instance. An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types . The String data type is used for fields that can hold textual values like names, while the int (integer) data type is used for fields that can hold numeric valuesIn order to demonstrate how fields work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:You can access the fields of your created objects by using the .

So, for instance:the animal1 object is a ""dog"" with 4 legs to walk with; while,  the animal2 object is a ""duck"" with 2 legs to walk with.What sets the two objects apart is their current state.

666,"Programming is essentially thinking of solutions to problems in real life as a system. With any programming language, you need to know how to address real-life problems into something that could be accurately represented within a computer system. In order to begin programming with the Java programming language (or in fact, with any programming language), a programmer must first understand the basics of abstraction.Abstraction is the process of representing real-life problems and objects into your programs.Suppose a novelist, a painter and a programmer were asked to abstract (i.e., represent ) a real-life object in their work. Suppose, the real-life object that needs to be abstracted is an animal . Abstraction for a novelist would include writing the description of the animal whilst the painter would draw a picture of the animal – but what about a computer programmer?The Java programming language uses a programming paradigm called object-oriented programming (OOP) , which shows you exactly what a programmer needs to be doing. According to OOP, every object or problem in real-life can be translated into a virtual object within your computer system.",Glossary The process of abstraction,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Glossary
667,"In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an object within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):The code above creates a space within your code where you can start defining an object; this space is called a class ( or type) definition . All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets – anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called Animal for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., class ). Such predefined words in the Java language are known as keywords and make up the grammar for the language (known as programming syntax ).",Glossary Thinking in objects,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Glossary
668,"Aristotle was perhaps the first person to think of abstract types or typologies of objects. He started calling them classes – e.g., classes of birds, classes of mammals. Class definitions therefore serve the purpose well in defining the common characteristics or types of objects you would be creating. Upon declaring a class definition, you can create objects based on that definition. In order to do so however, you need to write a special syntax that goes like this:The code above effectively creates an object called dog based on the class definition for Animal . In non-programmer parlance, the code above would translate into something akin to saying, ""Create a new object dog of type Animal ."" A single class definition enables you to create multiple objects as the code below indicates:Basically, you just have to write the code for your class or type definition once, and then use it to create countless numbers of objects based on that specification. Although you might not grasp the importance of doing so, this little exercise saves you a lot of time (a luxury that was not readily available to programmers in the pre-Java days).",Glossary Understanding class definitions and types,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Glossary
669,"Although each object you create from a class definition is essentially the same, there has to be a way of differentiating those objects in your code. Object fields (or simply fields ) are what makes your objects unique from other objects. Let's take our present abstraction for instance. An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: name (a common name given to any one of these animals) and legs (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:In the code above you defined two object fields:a field called name of type String ; and,  a field called legs of type int .These special pre-defined types are called data types . The String data type is used for fields that can hold textual values like names, while the int (integer) data type is used for fields that can hold numeric valuesIn order to demonstrate how fields work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:You can access the fields of your created objects by using the . (dot) or membership operator . In the example above, we created two objects: animal1 and animal2 of type Animal . And since, we had established that each Animal has two fields namely name and legs , we accessed and modified these fields for each of our objects using the membership operator to set the two apart. By declaring different values for different objects, we can manipulate their current state . So, for instance:the animal1 object is a ""dog"" with 4 legs to walk with; while,  the animal2 object is a ""duck"" with 2 legs to walk with.What sets the two objects apart is their current state. Both the objects have different states and thus stand out as two different objects even though they were created from the same template or class definition.",Glossary Expanding your class definitions,https://en.wikibooks.org//wiki/Java_Programming/Glossary
670,"At this point, your objects do nothing more than declare a bunch of fields. Being a system, your objects should have the ability to interact with its environment and other systems as well. To add this capability for interaction, you need to add interactive behavior to your object class definitions as well. Such behavior is added to class definitions using a programming construct called method .In the case of the Animal , you require your virtual representation of an animal to be able to move through its environment. Let's say, as an analogy, you want your Animal object to be able to walk in its environment. Thus, you need to add a method named walk to our object. To do so, we need to write the following code:As you write this code, one thing becomes immediately apparent. Just like the class description, a method has curly brackets as well. Generally, curly brackets are used to define an area (or scope ) within your object. So the first set of curly brackets defined a scope for your class definition called the class-level scope .
